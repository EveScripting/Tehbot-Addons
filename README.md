<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wanted to contribute to the Behaviors & Minimodes being written for Tehbot to help grow the use of it without having to submit pull requests for each update and without having to add to the creators plate of then supporting my additional code. Standard Addons are what ship with Tehbot. 

Here's why:
* If I ever stop supporting the code it will not be on the Tehbot creator to then pickup where I left off.
* Issues can be logged here to me and not on the main Tehbot github allowing me to work on them at my pace.
* You can form this and not worry about messing up any of the core Tehbot files

### Built With

Below you will find a link to Tehbot fork we are using when writing these, some are using sqlite and that is why I choose to use the forked version over the core version (along with a bunch of other quality of life changes).

* [Tehbot Fork](https://github.com/Francisco-Franks/Tehbot)
* [ISXSQLite Repo](https://github.com/isxGames/isxSQLite)
