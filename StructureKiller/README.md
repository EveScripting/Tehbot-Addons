<p>
This behavior allows you to set who your leaders is, it will then begin approching the leader, if you are the leader then it will orbit the target structure. This will begin locking and firing on the closest structure available to us (Citadels & Customs Offices). This currently is specific to the Triglavian ships (Tested so far using Kiki and Vedmaks)
